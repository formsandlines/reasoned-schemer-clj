# “The Reasoned Schemer” Notebook

My personal notebook for learning/exploring logic programming with [The Reasoned Schemer (2nd ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer-second-edition), using Clojures [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) library.

Maybe some of this helps others who also try to use Clojure with the book instead of Scheme. I cannot guarantee that I got everything right, so please correct me if you happen to notice a mistake in my understanding or translation.
